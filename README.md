# Chat/Messaging App Light and Dark Theme - Flutter

> Building a messing/chat app **UI** using **Flutter** that runs both Android and iOS devices also has a dark and light theme. We create in total 4 screens all of that support both Dark Theme and Light Theme. At first, we design a welcome screen that contains an image with a tag line also has a skip button. Once the user press, its transfers to the Sign-in or Sign-up screen. The last two screens are the main screen, Chats screens it shows the list of people you are chated with. At the end message screen which support text message, audio message, and video messages.

What I learn by doing or repeat this project?

- How to use Google fonts?
- Where is Flutter project config file?
- How components and screens files works in flutter?
- How detect Phone dark mode enabled or no?
- How control theme style?
- How share some config or global variable between all of components and screens?
- etc...

So do not be afraid to repeat something.

Even if it sounds ridiculous, it helps you gain new experience and learn new things.
And this is great.

### How I extract function or Flutter element names?

Manualy search in all of project files via your IDE/editor with `:(\s*|)([a-zA-Z]+)\(` regex query.

Or get names by running a PHP script:

```php
<?php
$data = file_get_contents("all-files-code.txt");
preg_match_all('/:(\s*|)([a-zA-Z]+)\(/i', $data, $matches);
// print_r($matches[2]);
foreach($matches[2] as $func) {
	print $func . "\n";
}
?>
```

Remove duplicate lines and Sort function names Alphabetical with https://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-duplicate-lines.php online service.
