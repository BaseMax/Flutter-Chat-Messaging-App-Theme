> Building a messing/chat app **UI** using **Flutter** that runs both Android and iOS devices also has a dark and light theme. We create in total 4 screens all of that support both Dark Theme and Light Theme. At first, we design a welcome screen that contains an image with a tag line also has a skip button. Once the user press, its transfers to the Sign-in or Sign-up screen. The last two screens are the main screen, Chats screens it shows the list of people you are chated with.
